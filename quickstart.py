    ### spam likes, dislikes and superlikes
    ### to avoid being banned:
    ### - it's best to apply a randomness in your liking by sometimes disliking.
    ### - some sleeping between two actions is recommended
    # by default the amount is 1, ratio 100% and sleep 1 second
    
    #session.like(amount=20, ratio="72.5%", sleep=1)

    ## Getting matches takes a while, so recommended you load as much as possible from local storage
    ## get new matches, with whom you haven't interacted yet
    ## Let's load the first 10 new matches to interact with later on.
    ## quickload on false will make sure ALL images are stored, but this might take a lot more time
    #new_matches = session.get_new_matches(amount=4, quickload=False)
    #print(f'Quantidade de matches {new_matches}')

    ## get already interacted with matches (matches with whom you've chatted already)
    # messaged_matches = session.get_messaged_matches()
    
    ## you can store the data and images of these matches now locally in data/matches
    ## For now let's just store the messaged_matches
    #for match in messaged_matches:
    #    session.store_local(match)

    ## Pick up line with their personal name so it doesn't look spammy
    #pickup_line = "Eu aqui tentando parecer descolado, mas sÃ³ pensando em como puxar assunto com vocÃª sem pagar mico. EntÃ£o: oi! ðŸ˜…"

    ## loop through my new matches and send them the first message of the conversation
    #for match in new_matches:
        ## store name and chatid in variables so we can use it more simply later on
        #name = match.get_name()
        #id = match.get_chat_id()

        #print(name, id)

        ## Format the match her/his name in your pickup line for a more personal approach.
        #message = pickup_line

        ## send pick up line with their name in it to all my matches
        #session.send_message(chatid=id, message=message)

        ## send a funny gif
        #session.send_gif(chatid=id, gifname="")

        ## send a funny song
        #session.send_song(chatid=id, songname="")

        ## send instagram or other socials like facebook, phonenumber and snapchat
        #session.send_socials(chatid=id, media=Socials.INSTAGRAM, value="david.aluc")

        ## you can also unmatch
        #session.unmatch(chatid=id)

    ## let's scrape some geomatches now
    #for _ in range(5):
        ## get profile data (name, age, bio, images, ...)
        #geomatch = session.get_geomatch(quickload=False)
        ## store this data locally as json with reference to their respective (locally stored) images
        #session.store_local(geomatch)
        ## dislike the profile, so it will show us the next geomatch (since we got infinite amount of dislikes anyway)
        #session.dislike()
